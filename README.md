This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It showcases a simple project built with redux and Higher order components.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Look through the codebase to get a glance of how redux saga is used and structured in a project and the use of higher order components to abstract functionalities. Lets keep having fun!
